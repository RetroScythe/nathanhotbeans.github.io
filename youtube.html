			[i]<br> The RetroScythe YouTube channel is where most of the RetroScythe community resides, whether you are just a viewer or are a long time follower, this is where the top quality content can be found.<br><br>
			
			[Content]<br> The channel is mainly focused on my old and ongoing projects. As of now, there are videos about my treehouses, homemade car and an old banger car series. Other types of content may show up from time to time 
			such as gaming videos. <br><br>
			
			[History]<br> Starting in 2015, "RXCreeper13" (The original channel name) was occasionally gifted with some very crudely made videos, they were recorded and uploaded straight to youtube. Most of these videos were ROBLOX. These videos featured moments that were simply
			not believable, so much so that people just disliked the videos and called it all fake (Welcome to the internet!). Those videos are now private to keep the channel cleaner and have since been replaced by videos with
			a much higher standard for quality and entertainment value.<br>

			The channel started to gain popularity around early 2020 from Minecraft videos. the channel was mainly gaming but featured the occasional video that was non-gaming related.<br>
			
			In 2023, the channel was relaunched for a new type of content. The main reason was that me and my friends had lost interest in gaming and started to gain interest in our projects. From today, the channel is focused mainly on these projects.

			[Characters]<br><br>
			
			"RetroScythe / Nathan" - Born in 2001, Nathan is the host of the channel. He's easy to spot because he will often be in his natural habitat crashing cars, building a car or in a treehouse. He is loud, proud and a total orangutan.<br><br>
			
			"MattyTheNoob / Matty / Matthew" - Also born in 2001, Matty is an old lady orangutan. He is quite slow and laughs at stupid things. If you want to think of a person to compare Matty to, combine the slowness of James May, the shortness of Richard Hammond and the loudness plus ability to break things of Jeremy Clarkson.<br><br>
			
			"Sanguinius / Stevie" - Born in 2003 (noob), Stevie is a very fragile boy. He is obsessed with trains, three wheeled cars and top gear. He currently has his own series on the channel about restoring a Relliant Robin which is a very difficult task. Also he is terrible at driving.<br><br>
			
			"CRZ / Charlie" - Born in 2003 (noob), charlie is an interesting boy who loves fire, cars, treehouses and exploring abandoned buildings. He is a fast and stupid driver who gets from A-B most of the time, occasionally he ends up in A+E instead. Slightly crashy but seems to be doing alright for now.
